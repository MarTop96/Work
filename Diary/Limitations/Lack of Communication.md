# Lack of Communication

### In Teams:
In order for teams to work successfully, they must clearly communicate with each other. Teams must be able to trust each other and [collaborate](Collaboration.md) in order to ensure that tasks are completed effectively. It is also important that team members respect and support each other, and any disagreements should be discussed openly and with respect. 

More importantly, teams should have a clear and shared goal in mind, and everyone should be working towards the same objectives. Additionally, teams should have a leader who can help guide the team and ensure that tasks are completed on time and to a high standard.

### **Key Ideas**
- Clear communication between team members
- Mutual trust and collaboration 
- Respect and support for each other
- Open discussion of disagreements 
- Clear, shared goal 
- Leader to guide team 
- Tasks completed on time, to a high standard

### [Across Teams](Cross-Talking.md):
Cross talking on a task can help teams to ensure that all members are on the same page and are working towards the same goal. It can help to clarify any misunderstandings, identify any potential issues, and ensure that everyone is on the same page. Cross talking also allows teams to brainstorm ideas, share resources, and provide feedback. This can help to ensure that the task is completed efficiently and effectively. Finally, cross talking can help to foster collaboration and build relationships between team members, which can lead to increased productivity and better results.

When teams share why they need the information required from each other, it helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that the team is working together collaboratively. Sharing why the information is needed can help to reduce any potential misunderstandings and can help to ensure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to the project. Additionally, it can help to foster better communication and collaboration between the team members, which can lead to better results.

- Clarify misunderstandings, identify potential issues, foster collaboration, and build relationships
