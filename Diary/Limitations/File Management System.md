Need to have a better file management system. Onedrive shows nothing. Something similar to google docs. Can see who edited what, when. Who is on the document, what they are doing. Has a chat feature and a comment feature so questions can be asked, or left for an answer to be given.

So many independent files, worst integration possible. Every uses their own individual files, individual systems, individual styles etc. No one works through the same consistent document, no collaboration besides copy pasting values from each other's files.

### OneDrive
OneDrive is a terrible file management system because of its lack of file structure. It doesn't allow users to [optimally organize files](Efficiency.md), or create any kind of structure to help them better[organize](Efficiency.md) their documents due to the enormous amount of sharing that occurs. This makes it difficult to quickly locate and access documents, and makes it easy to misplace important files. Furthermore, it can be [difficult to back up](Lack%20of%20Backup.md) and share documents with others, as organizing them into specific folders, causes even more of a burden with endless folders. Furthermore, it can be difficult to keep track of changes to documents, as there is no way to easily compare versions of the same document. All in all, OneDrive’s lack of file structure makes it an [inefficient and unreliable](Unintuitive.md) file management system.

In addition, OneDrive is incredibly slow to load documents, making it difficult to work quickly and efficiently. This can be extremely frustrating, especially when programs constantly crash while attempting to load documents from the OneDrive. This slowness can create a [bottleneck in workflow](Efficiency.md), and can prevent people from accomplishing their tasks in a timely manner. Furthermore, this delay can also lead to a lack of productivity, as it can be difficult to stay focused and motivated when progress is hindered by a slow loading speed.

Furthermore, OneDrive does not allow users to see when other users have edited or accessed documents. This makes [collaboration](Collaboration.md) more challenging and can lead to [misunderstandings and dissatisfaction](Efficiency.md) among users. Additionally, it can be difficult to keep track of changes to documents, as users are unable to view the history of edits and accesses. This can lead to [duplicate work and wasted time](Efficiency.md), as users may be unaware of changes that have already been made. Ultimately, this lack of visibility can cause frustration and confusion among users and can make collaborative work more difficult.

OneDrive provides very minimal user information, making it difficult to track or monitor user activity or usage. This lack of visibility into user activity makes it difficult to determine which coworkers files are relevant to them. Furthermore, there is no way to easily monitor the usage of these files, so it can be difficult to ensure that the right people have access to the right documents.. As a result, it can be difficult to ensure that users are using the platform in a secure and efficient manner.

Overall, OneDrive is a terrible file management system due to its lack of file structure, slow loading times, inability to see other users’ edits, and minimal user information.

## Wrong names
OneDrive's inability to allow multiple users to access the same document at the same time can lead to [duplicate work and wasted time](Efficiency.md). This is because multiple users may make edits to the same document, but save a copy of the document, leading to multiple uncollated versions of the same document. This can lead to errors, as changes made in one version of the document may not be reflected in the other versions, leading to [unknown changes and edits](Lack%20of%20Communication.md). In addition, this can lead to confusion and frustration, as users may not be aware of the different versions and which version contains the most up-to-date information. This can lead to unnecessary duplication of work, as users may not be aware of changes already made in other versions. Furthermore, it can also lead to wasted time as users may spend time making changes to a version of the document that has already been updated in another version.

In CNHi, names for files aren't even updated for the actual documents. Using files from 2022 instead of the 2023 file, because an individual forgot to update or rollover to the new file. This is entirely unacceptable and extremely inefficient, error prone and just should not occur. Instead of it being remedied, everbody [just accepts](Unintuitive.md) this and works with it. This example of inefficient and error-prone document management is an ongoing issue in CNHi that has been accepted as the [norm](Company%20Culture.md). This lack of proper file management has a far-reaching impact on the organization. Not only does it lead to confusion and frustration, but it also slows down the workflow and can lead to incorrect decisions being made. In addition, it wastes valuable time and resources that could be spent on more productive tasks.
