# Lack of IT Training

Watching people, could use basic IT training. Not knowing how to use basic excel stuff. Instead of using the obvious search bar, scrolling through hundreds of options.. Etc.

Minimal amount of organisation of files. Just one main folder, hosting infinite sub-files, instead of branching folders. Flooded desktops.
