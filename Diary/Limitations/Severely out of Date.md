From what I have seen a lot of the things that people seem to have trouble with, such as the VPN stuff, etc, can literally be solved with this, if it was just updated, broken up into its subsections so people can have a 2 minute refresher whenever it is they need. Also bring it more to the forefront.

Eg. People all over the office having had issues with the VPN stuff. Its literally explained here (poorly as not updated) which would have prevented so many email chains and IT needing to waste time.
