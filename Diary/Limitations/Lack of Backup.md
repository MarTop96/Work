# Lack of Backup

## Staff 
#### **Examples**
1. I spoke with "X", about how they came into their role. They had said, before they moved into this new role intercompany, they were told there would be in-company training. The previous individual who would be leaving the company, would train them. Upon arriving for the first day of training, the individual had found out that not only did that individual already leave, there was not going to be any training, and that their first day in their new role begun at that moment. This individual was then thrusted into the new role, and having had no training, was just told to swim.

This lack of having some form of backup creates these kinds of problems. I have noticed there does not seem to be some sort of real procedure or process for these kinds of situations. If a staff member were to leave, who can actually replace them? Put it this way, the [File Management System](File%20Management%20System.md) is setup to be completely individualised. If someone leaves, their files remain on this system. Only they know where they put their files, what their names are, how they're structured and even how to read them. This is the problem with anti-[collaboration](Collaboration.md). In this sense, more power is given to individuals than is necessarily realised.
