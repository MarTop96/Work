## User Menus
The amount of unfriendly GUIs certain employees encounter, or the amount of portals they encounter, is absolutely unintuitive, inefficient and an extreme overload. Looking at any form of SAP GUI is awful. Whether its registering, or accessing components.

Unfriendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and multiple web portals can create significant challenges for workers in various ways. Here are some of the reasons:
1. Increased cognitive load: Unfriendly GUIs and multiple web portals can increase the cognitive load on workers by requiring them to remember different sets of instructions, commands, and interface elements for each system. This can lead to increased mental fatigue, decreased productivity, and more errors.
2. Inefficiency: Workers may need to switch between multiple systems to access the information they need, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. This can also make it challenging for workers to complete tasks that require information from multiple systems.
3. Learning curve: Unfriendly GUIs and multiple web portals may require additional training for workers to learn how to navigate each system. This can be time-consuming and costly for employers, and it can also decrease employee satisfaction.
4. User frustration: Workers may become frustrated with unfriendly GUIs and multiple web portals, leading to increased stress and decreased job satisfaction. This can also increase turnover rates and decrease employee morale.

In summary, unfriendly GUIs and multiple web portals can create significant challenges for workers, leading to increased cognitive load, inefficiency, longer learning curves, and user frustration. As such, companies should invest in user-friendly interfaces and streamline their systems to help employees be more productive and satisfied in their jobs.
