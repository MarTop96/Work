# Afraid of Change
Being afraid of change can hinder a worker's ability to perform efficiently because it can cause them to become stuck in a routine and not be open to new ideas and processes. 

#### **Examples**: 
1. I had attempted to increase efficiency and performance in the given task at hand. The current process involved only one individual being able to write at any given moment, whilst the other one was locked out. I had overcome this, and provided a new way for us both to be able to read and write to the file thus essentially doubling efficiency. I had also begun colour coding and attempting to enhance legibility to also increase efficiency. Unfortunately, the coworker upon seeing this change, said "<u>Oh can we just do it the way it was already done?</u>" This comment shows that the coworker is resistant to change and is [unwilling](Company%20Culture.md) to try [new ideas and processes](Lack%20of%20Backup.md), which can lead to stagnation in the workplace. Instead we had to [fallback](Unintuitive.md) to the [old archaic method](Lack%20of%20IT%20Training.md), that's ineffective, inefficient and not only makes it more challenging but more tedious. 
2. I was allocated a task, that was quite a tedious one. It involved manual searches, one by one of over a couple hundred data values. The average speed upon each search was around 7 seconds give or take the connection and loading speed of the browser. Upon seeing this, I created a tool, that would mass search the entirety of the hundred data values all at once, and spit out the needed data. This effectively reduced the time needed by roughly an hour. I showed that tool to another individual who is regularly looking up those data values on a daily basis, and unfortunately, I heard NOTHING back in regards to it. Not only was it overlooked, it was just [completely ignored](Lack%20of%20Knowledge.md).

When workers are afraid of change, they can become complacent and not be motivated to make improvements or find more efficient ways of working. This can lead to a decrease in productivity and a decrease in overall performance. Additionally, it can prevent workers from adapting to new technologies and processes, which can lead to an inability to keep up with the changing times and stay competitive in the market. 

Overall, being afraid of change can hinder a worker's ability to perform efficiently because it can lead to stagnation, decrease productivity, and prevent them from adapting to new technologies and processes.
