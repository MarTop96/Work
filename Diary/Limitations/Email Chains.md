Endless email chains back and forth for just basic information. 
Due to the [FMS](File%20Management%20System.md) and [lack of communication](Lack%20of%20Communication.md) or [team to team](Cross-Talking.md):
- **No way to know WHO uses a file.** I only know the file IS used. Not knowing who uses a file on the computer is important because it ensures the privacy and security of the file. If someone else were to gain access to the file, they could use the information stored in it for malicious purposes. Additionally, if the file contains confidential information, it is important to keep it secure and not allow anyone else to access it.
- **No way to know WHY a file is used/needed.** What part of the data is useful? What isn't useful? What is pointless? Knowing which part of data provided being useful is important because it helps to ensure that the [data collected is relevant and accurate](Efficiency.md). It also helps to ensure that the data is used in the most efficient way possible, as data that is not useful will be a waste of time and resources. Knowing which part of data is useful also helps to make sure that the data is used for the intended purpose and that it is not being used for any other purpose that could be potentially harmful.
- **No way to know WHEN a file is needed.** Is it a popular file that everyone relies upon thus its urgent? Knowing when a file is needed is important because it helps ensure that the file is available at the correct time. This can help [prevent delays](Efficiency.md) in projects or tasks that rely on the file, as well as help prevent data loss. Additionally, knowing when a file is needed can help ensure that the file is stored in the correct location so that it can be easily accessed on time.
- **No way to know WHAT file is used/needed.** Nor the information inside the file. Knowing what file is used or needed is important because it helps to ensure that you are using the [correct file for the task](Lack%20of%20Knowledge.md) you are working on. For example, if you are trying to open a document, you need to make sure that you are using the correct file format to open the document. Without knowing what file is needed, you could potentially open the wrong file, which could cause the document to become corrupted or unusable. Knowing what file is needed also helps to ensure that you are using the [most up-to-date](Severely%20out%20of%20Date.md) version of the file, which can help to prevent errors or compatibility issues.
- **No way to know HOW a file is used.** Do people not use the data and just need the template? Or is my [template terrible for people](Collaboration.md) and ineffective and thus individuals remove the template. It is important to know how a file is used because it can help you determine if the file is necessary for the task at hand, if it is safe to delete, or if it is taking up too much space on your computer. Knowing the purpose of a file can also help you identify any [potential security risks](Lack%20of%20IT%20Training.md) associated with it. Additionally, knowing how a file is used can help you make sure it is being used in the most [efficient](Efficiency.md) way possible.
