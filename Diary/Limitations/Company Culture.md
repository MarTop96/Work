# Company Culture

Company culture refers to the shared values, beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that define how people work together in CNHi. A negative company culture is one that promotes behaviors and attitudes that undermine productivity, collaboration, and employee morale. This type of culture can create limitations in several ways that can have a significant impact on the success of CNHi.

Firstly, a negative company culture can limit CNHi's ability to attract and retain top talent. People want to work for companies that share their values and provide a positive work environment. If a company has a culture that is toxic or unpleasant, it can be challenging to attract and retain high-quality employees. This can result in a lack of diversity, which can limit innovation and creativity, and reduce the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions.

Secondly, a negative company culture can limit employee engagement and motivation. When employees feel unsupported, undervalued, or unappreciated, they are less likely to be motivated to do their best work. This can lead to a decrease in productivity, an increase in absenteeism and turnover, and a negative impact on the bottom line.

Thirdly, a negative company culture can limit collaboration and teamwork. In an environment where people don't trust or respect each other, they are less likely to share ideas or work together effectively. This can lead to silos within CNHi, where different departments or teams don't communicate or collaborate effectively. This can result in duplicated efforts, missed opportunities, and a lack of coordination that can limit the company's ability to achieve its goals.

Finally, a negative company culture can limit innovation and creativity. In an environment where people are discouraged from taking risks or thinking outside the box, there is little room for experimentation or creativity. This can limit the company's ability to develop new products or services, or to respond to changing customer needs or market conditions.
