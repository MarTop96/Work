# Cross-Talking

The absence of cross-talk or cross-team communication in CNHi can create significant limitations and can affect the overall performance and productivity of CNHi. When communication is limited, employees may not have a clear understanding of why certain tasks or reports are necessary, leading to confusion, errors, and misunderstandings. This lack of communication can lead to a lack of direction and coordination, resulting in missed deadlines and missed opportunities.

Within teams, the lack of cross-talk can lead to silos, where individuals work independently without sharing information or collaborating effectively. This can create a lack of cohesion and teamwork, resulting in a lack of shared knowledge and a decreased ability to solve complex problems. It can also lead to duplication of effort and a waste of resources, as employees may not be aware of what their colleagues are working on.

Additionally, not having cross-talk between teams can lead to a lack of understanding and coordination between different parts of CNHi. This can create inefficiencies and a lack of synergy, resulting in delays and missed opportunities. It can also lead to a lack of alignment between different teams, resulting in conflicts and misunderstandings.

As a result, employees may not be able to perform their tasks as efficiently as possible, which can lead to delays and a decrease in productivity. It can also lead to a lack of motivation and engagement among employees, as they may not feel valued or included in the overall direction of CNHi.

#### **For Example**: 
<u>"I need this report."</u>

It is evident that communication is only seen as necessary when there is an urgent need for it. This mindset can create limitations, as it can lead to a lack of collaboration and cooperation between different teams and departments. Without proper communication, employees may not have access to essential information, such as who posted certain items or why specific reports are necessary. This lack of understanding can lead to a lack of ownership and accountability, resulting in a lack of urgency and commitment towards the task.

<u>"Donâ€™t even know who posted things sometimes, it's literally anonymous, I just know It's for me."</u>

Furthermore, the anonymous nature of communication can also create limitations. When employees do not know who is responsible for certain tasks, they may not know who to reach out to when they have questions or need assistance. This can lead to a lack of support and guidance, resulting in employees feeling unsupported and overwhelmed. Additionally, anonymous communication can create an environment of distrust and suspicion, which can negatively impact the overall culture of CNHi.
