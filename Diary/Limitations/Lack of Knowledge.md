# Lack of Knowledge

When teams do not have a clear understanding of the purpose of a system or process, it can be challenging to identify and address errors or inefficiencies. 

#### **Examples**:
1. **Understanding software**: If a team does not understand the purpose of a particular software module, they may not recognize when the module is not functioning correctly. Most employees, don't underastand how to utilize excel menus. They do not understand the functions of the buttons, and thus avoid them. Even further, an even larger amount of members, have no idea how to use formulas, and work that could be expedited, is not, and thus becomes tumultuous and tedious. 
2. **Understanding the method**: It has become evident that some individuals do not actually understand the underlying methodology of the processes they are performing. For example, in regards to the general trade flow; a lot of individuals think that the Dealer is the one directly invoiced. This is not the case, as **CAPITAL** is the one invoiced. It seems that users understand the "how to" but not the "why". Meaning if something in the process changes, would these employees know what to do?
