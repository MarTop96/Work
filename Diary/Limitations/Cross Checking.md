# Cross Checking

The lack of cross-checking in CNHi can create significant limitations and can have a negative impact on the overall system. When employees work independently and do not have someone else review their work, it is more likely that errors will go undetected. This is because individuals may overlook mistakes or assume that their work is correct. When tasks are delegated without any cross-checking, it can lead to various issues and mistakes that can cause problems down the line.

For example, an employee completed their work without having anyone check it (it was their TASK to check their OWN work), which resulted in an error that went undetected until it had already progressed down the line. This type of situation can lead to delays, rework, and even system failures, which can be costly for CNHi. It can also result in a lack of trust in the employee's abilities, which can affect their confidence and overall job performance.

Moreover, not having cross-checking in place can lead to a lack of consistency and quality in the work produced. When employees work independently, they may have different interpretations or standards of quality, which can lead to inconsistency in the final output. This can be especially problematic in industries that require high levels of accuracy, such as finance or healthcare. A lack of cross-checking can also make it more challenging to identify and correct errors in a timely manner, which can lead to more significant problems down the line.
