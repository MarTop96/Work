Got given the task of making sure that the SalesForce/SAP entities names align with whats on the invoice, ABN check, and that the entity name on ABN lookup matches. If they donâ€™t match, then have to mark it as System Update Required, and Invoice Update Required.

Example:
![775x140](../../../Images/Vendor%20Alignment%20Task.png)


**Process**:
1. Basically open up an invoice for entity
2. input the ABN into ABN IN INVOICE column
3. input the supplier name in NEXT column
4. BSB -Acc. No.
5. Then ABN Lookup and make sure its valid
6. Make sure the entity name matches the First Column Name
7. If not Mark the column Either Yes or No
8. If No, Update with new Entity Name
9. Check if SalesForce (first column) and MASTER SAP (worksheet 2) have corresponding entity name.
10. If no, mark the system update requirement correspondingly.
11. Mark Invoice as needing update if needed.


**Diary Addition:** 
First 4 hours, had nothing to do, teams were super busy and had to wait for allocation.

Did [onboarding modules](../../Limitations/Severely%20out%20of%20Date.md). Finding other recommended modules pointless. Why would I do them? I dont really get anyting from them, theres no incentive, not required and not even marked or given feedback.

After lunch got given my first task. Reconcile suppliers, fix the previous persons mistakes.
1. Check invoice for Entity Name, ABN
2. ABN Lookup if entity name matches ABN lookup cool. If not check SF and SAP for match.
3. If no match update either/both.
4. Update Invoice if needed.

Tedious process. [Faster Ways?](../../Limitations/Efficiency.md)
