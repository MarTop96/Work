# Cross-Talking Improvements

### Team on Team engagement
When teams "cross-talk" and communicate with each other about their work and its purpose, it can help build a more comprehensive understanding of CNHi's goals and how each team contributes to them. For example, if the sales team understands how the marketing team generates leads, they can work more effectively to convert those leads into customers.

Understanding how reports or data are used can also help teams improve their work. In the case of the report mentioned, knowing who is using it and why can help the report creator tailor the report to better meet the needs of its users, or even identify opportunities for new reports that better serve CNHi.

Effective communication and collaboration between teams can also promote a sense of shared purpose and encourage everyone to work together towards common goals. This can foster a more positive and productive work environment, where everyone feels valued and motivated to contribute to CNHi's success.

Cross-talk and open communication between teams can help improve understanding, collaboration, and efficiency within CNHi. By sharing information about their work and its purpose, teams can better align their efforts, improve the quality of their work, and ultimately contribute to CNHi's success.
