## Data Dictionary
A data dictionary is a structured repository that contains information about the data elements or attributes within a dataset, such as data type, size, description, and other relevant details. It serves as a reference for anyone who wants to access or analyze the data, including database administrators, data analysts, and developers.

In a file management system, data dictionaries can be incredibly useful as they help in maintaining consistency, accuracy, and data integrity. Here are some ways data dictionaries can help:

1. **Data Quality**: Data dictionaries ensure that data is consistent and accurate by enforcing standards and rules for data entry, format, and structure.
2. **Data Integration**: Data dictionaries help integrate data from different sources by providing a common language and format for data elements, making it easier to exchange information between different systems.
3. **Data Documentation**: Data dictionaries provide a comprehensive documentation of the data, making it easier to understand the relationships and dependencies between different data elements.
4. **System Maintenance**: Data dictionaries can help reduce the time and effort required to maintain the system by providing a central repository of information that can be easily updated and accessed by system administrators and developers.

In summary, data dictionaries play a crucial role in managing data and maintaining data quality in file management systems. They provide a centralized repository for information about the data, ensuring consistency and accuracy, facilitating data integration, and reducing the time and effort required for system maintenance.

## Wrong Names Solution Idea
The root cause of this issue is a lack of proper oversight and control, which should be addressed immediately. The organization should [create and enforce policies](../Limitations/Company%20Culture.md) that require documents to be updated and rolled over in a timely manner. Furthermore, they should provide [training and support](../Limitations/Lack%20of%20IT%20Training.md) to ensure that everyone understands the importance of proper document management. Finally, they should ensure that all documents are properly labeled and organized, so that they can be easily located and accessed. By taking these steps, CNHi can ensure that their document management system is efficient, effective, and secure.

First idea is a REAL Masterfile. Not a fake one. One master file, styled one certain way and thatâ€™s it. Everyone has to input their information into this ONE key file. Everyone can then access their required data from this one KEY file into their own individual file. The Masterfile will essentially be the data host. Contains the same style, never changed, only added values. Everyone picks from it, makes their data, then returns their data back into the Masterfile.

![Master File Example](../../Images/Master%20File%20Example.png)
1. 1 Gives to Master
  Master gives to 2
2. 2 Gives to Master
Master Gives to 5
3. 5 Gives to Master
Master Gives to 1
4. 1 Gives to Master
Master Gives to 4
5. 4 Gives to Master
Master Gives to 3

Each Individual can thus have their own independent worksheet, their own style, their own everything to make it suitable for them. Everything is fed into the Master Sheet from their worksheets. Everything is retrieved from the Master Sheet for them.

The Master can contain comments, for what the figures are, the questions asked, needed, etc. Figures explained. Why they are needed, what their purpose is. ETC.. GOOGLE DOCS OR WHATEVER.
