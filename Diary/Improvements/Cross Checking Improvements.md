# Cross Checking Improvements
To mitigate the risks associated with a lack of cross-checking, it is essential to establish a system for reviewing and validating work. One approach that can be effective is to use the same files across different stages of the process. By doing this, it becomes easier to track changes and identify any discrepancies or errors. Additionally, it promotes consistency and ensures that everyone is working from the same source of information. This is especially important when dealing with complex or technical information that requires a high degree of accuracy.

In addition to using the same files, another approach that can be effective is to establish a process for cross-checking work. This can involve having someone else review and validate the work of others. For example, in the scenario provided, the employee could have had a colleague review her work before progressing it down the line. This would have provided an opportunity to identify any errors or discrepancies before they caused a problem in the overall system.

Ultimately, the key to addressing the challenges associated with a lack of cross-checking is to promote better integration and collaboration across different stages of the process. This means establishing clear processes for reviewing and validating work, as well as promoting a culture of openness and transparency. By doing this, it becomes easier to identify and address issues before they become more significant problems. It also promotes a sense of shared responsibility for the overall success of CNHi, which is essential for creating a sustainable and resilient system.
